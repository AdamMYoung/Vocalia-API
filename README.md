## Vocalia API

## About
Vocalia is a podcast consumption platform built in React. The application features:
- Microservice Architecture
- Azure component integration
- Docker Compose container management
- iTunes API parsing and caching
- Auth0 authentication API integration

Please note that all Azure and Auth0 endpoints have been closed down, and as such the connection informaton currently in place is meaningless. This project was published to allow people to gain a better understanding of the microservice and .NET Core architecture and framework, and to potentially learn how the platform was developed.
